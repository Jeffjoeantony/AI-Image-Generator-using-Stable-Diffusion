# Restaurant Food Billing Program 🍽️

A basic Python application that simulates a restaurant billing system. It collects customer details, displays a menu, allows the user to order two food items, and generates a final bill. This project was created as part of an internship task to apply fundamental Python concepts in a real-world context.

---

## 📌 Features

- Takes customer name and phone number as input
- Displays a predefined menu (stored as a dictionary)
- Accepts orders for up to 2 food items
- Calculates total bill based on quantity and price
- Displays customer details, order summary, and total cost

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Python Functions: `input()`, `print()`
- Data Types: `str`, `int`, `float`
- Data Structures: Dictionaries (for menu), Tuples (for customer info)
- Control Flow: `if`, `else`, `while` loops
- Arithmetic operations for bill calculation

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x

No additional libraries are required.

# 🧠 AI Image Generator using Stable Diffusion

This project is a text-to-image AI generator built using the **Stable Diffusion v1.4** model from Hugging Face's `diffusers` library. It takes a natural language prompt as input and produces a high-quality, realistic image based on the prompt using a diffusion-based generative model.

---

## 🔍 Features

- 📥 Accepts user-defined text prompts  
- 🤖 Loads and uses the `CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4` model  
- ⚡ Automatically detects and utilizes GPU (if available)  
- 🖼 Generates and displays AI-generated images  
- 💾 Saves the generated image to disk (`image.png`)

---

## 📦 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Hugging Face diffusers**
- **PyTorch**
- **PIL (Pillow)**
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** (for testing or running without local GPU)

---

## 💡 Use Cases

- Creative content generation for artists and writers  
- AI-assisted design for marketing and concept visualization  
- Educational demonstrations of text-to-image AI  
- Rapid prototyping for game and animation assets

## 🚀 Getting Started

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-billing-system.git
   cd food-billing-system
   python billing_program.py

## ❗ Limitations

  - Order is limited to 2 items only
  - No input validation for phone number
  - No error handling using try-except blocks

## 📚 Learning Outcome
  - Improved understanding of Python basics
  - Hands-on practice with data structures like dictionaries and tuples
  - Real-world use case for user input handling and billing logic

A rule-based restaurant service chatbot built with Python and CustomTkinter. It features a GUI with chat display, input field, and send button, responding to user queries with predefined rules. A beginner-friendly chatbot demonstrating GUI and logic handling.

# 🍽️ Restaurant Service Chatbot using Tkinter

A simple rule-based chatbot built using Python and CustomTkinter. This chatbot simulates a restaurant assistant by responding to user queries with predefined replies in a GUI interface. Built as part of the VervEox Technologies internship program.

---

## 🧠 Features

- GUI-based chatbot interface using `CustomTkinter`
- Rule-based logic with `if-else` statements
- Displays user and bot messages in a chat-style window
- Handles unmatched inputs with a default reply
- Start-up greeting message included

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3
- **GUI**: CustomTkinter (Tkinter + custom styling)
- **Logic**: Rule-based using `if-else` conditions

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- CustomTkinter library

Install with:

```bash
pip install customtkinter
