# Restaurant Food Billing Program 🍽️

A basic Python application that simulates a restaurant billing system. It collects customer details, displays a menu, allows the user to order two food items, and generates a final bill. This project was created as part of an internship task to apply fundamental Python concepts in a real-world context.

---

## 📌 Features

- Takes customer name and phone number as input
- Displays a predefined menu (stored as a dictionary)
- Accepts orders for up to 2 food items
- Calculates total bill based on quantity and price
- Displays customer details, order summary, and total cost

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Python Functions: `input()`, `print()`
- Data Types: `str`, `int`, `float`
- Data Structures: Dictionaries (for menu), Tuples (for customer info)
- Control Flow: `if`, `else`, `while` loops
- Arithmetic operations for bill calculation

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x

No additional libraries are required.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-billing-system.git
   cd food-billing-system
   python billing_program.py

## ❗ Limitations

  - Order is limited to 2 items only
  - No input validation for phone number
  - No error handling using try-except blocks

## 📚 Learning Outcome
  - Improved understanding of Python basics
  - Hands-on practice with data structures like dictionaries and tuples
  - Real-world use case for user input handling and billing logic
